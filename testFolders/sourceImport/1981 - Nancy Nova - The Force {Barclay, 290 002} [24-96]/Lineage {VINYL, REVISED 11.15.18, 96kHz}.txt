> Maximize gain at the analog stage, peaking somewhere between -6dBFS and -3dBFS
> Record to 32-bit 96kHz WAV
> Analyze integrated loudness (BS.1770-2/3/4) in mono using LUFS meter
> Adjust digital gain to correct L/R channel imbalance, using the waveform statistics as a reference
> Repair any severe short impulse noises manually using the RX de-click module (M-band) and spectral replace (partials + noise / pattern)
> Repair any collateral damage caused by the de-clicker using narrow crossfades in Ableton
> Split to mono, limit L/R channels separately using IRC II (smooth mode), then rejoin as split stereo
> Normalize everything to -1.10dBFS (as a single track to preserve album dynamics)
> Split tracks and fade (log in, cosine out)
> Reduce bit-rate using MBIT+ (dither = normal, noise shaping = none)
> Reduce sample-rate using SRC (filter = 32, cutoff = 0.95, pre-ringing = 1.00)
