> Record to 32-bit 96kHz WAV
> Analyze integrated loudness in mono using LKFS meter
> Analyze azimuth alignment using channel ops
> Normalize stereo channels separately to correct L/R bias, using results of steps 2 and 3 as a reference
> Adjust gain as a single track to preserve album dynamics
> Repair using manual de-click (M-band, random) and spectral replace (partials + noise / pattern)
> Split to mono, limit L/R channels separately using IRC II (smooth mode), then rejoin as split stereo
> Normalize everything to 1.10dBFS
> Split tracks and fade (log in, cosine out)
> Reduce bit-rate using MBIT+ (dither = normal, noise shaping = none)
> Reduce sample-rate using SRC (filter = 32, cutoff = 0.95, pre-ringing = 1.00)
